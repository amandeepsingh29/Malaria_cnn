# Malaria Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting malaria using machine learning. It involves data processing, visualization, and classification techniques to differentiate between infected and uninfected cell images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of cell images, which are processed and normalized for better model performance.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook MalariaDetection.ipynb
```

## Features
- Data visualization
- Data preprocessing (normalization)
- Machine learning classification

## Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:

- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model is trained to classify cell images and predict malaria presence with high accuracy.
